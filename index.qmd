# About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Methods in the Department of Educational Psychology working with [Dr. David Kaplan](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/kaplan-david/) and [Dr. Sameer Deshpande](https://skdeshpande91.github.io/) at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Prior to that, I graduated with a M.S. in Quantitative Methodology, Measurement and Statistics under the supervision of [Dr. Carolyn Anderson](https://cja.education.illinois.edu/) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\
\
My research involves developing and applying Bayesian Statistics as well as Machine Learning methods for problems in social and behavioral sciences. Currently, my work focuses on Bayesian nonparametrics and its application in large-scale clustered data.
